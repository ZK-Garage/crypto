_This is a pure Rust implementation of the PLONK zk proving system_


## About
Initial implementation created by [Kev](https://github.com/kevaundray), [Carlos](https://github.com/CPerezz) and [Luke](https://github.com/LukePearson1) at Dusk Network.
Redesigned by the [ZK-Garage](https://github.com/ZK-Garage) team to have a backend which is compatible with the [arkworks](https://github.com/arkworks-rs) suite. This allows us to leverage the multitude of curves and optimised algebra present in various arkworks repositories.

## Features

This crate includes a variety of features which will briefly be explained below:
- `parallel`: Enables `rayon` and other parallelisation primitives to be used and speed up some of the algorithms used
by the crate and it's dependencies.
- `asm`: Enables inline-assembly implementations for some of the internal algorithms and primitives used by the `arkworks` dependencies of the crate.
- `trace`: Enables the Circuit debugger tooling. This is essentially the capability of using the
`StandardComposer::check_circuit_satisfied` function. The function will output information about each circuit gate until one of the gates does not satisfy the equation, or there are no more gates. If there is an unsatisfied gate
equation, the function will panic and return the gate number.
- `trace-print`: Goes a step further than `trace` and prints each `gate` component data, giving a clear overview of all the
values which make up the circuit that we're constructing.
__The recommended method is to derive the std output, and the std error, and then place them in text file
  which can be used to efficiently analyse the gates.__



## Documentation

There are two main types of documentation in this repository:

- **Crate documentation**. This provides info about all of the functions that the library provides, as well
  as the documentation regarding the data structures that it exports. To check this, please feel free to go to
  the [documentation page](https://docs.rs/ark-plonk/) or run `make doc` or `make doc-internal`.

- **Notes**. This is a specific subset of documentation which explains the key mathematical concepts
  of PLONK and how they work with mathematical demonstrations. To check it, run `make doc` and open the resulting docs,
  which will be located under `/target` with your browser.
